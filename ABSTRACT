ABSTRACT

This project explores the automation of Flappy Bird using deep learning, focusing on training 
an AI agent to autonomously play the game by learning from gameplay interactions. The AI 
model analyses raw pixel-based game frames, extracts key features, and makes real-time 
decisions to maximize survival. By leveraging reinforcement learning principles, the agent 
interacts with the environment, continuously improving its decision-making through trial and 
error. The model refines its strategy over time, adapting to different obstacle patterns and 
improving overall gameplay performance. 
A deep neural network is employed to process game states and predict the best actions based 
on a reward-driven learning mechanism. The reinforcement learning model undergoes 
extensive training, addressing challenges such as sparse rewards, exploration-exploitation 
trade-offs, and stability issues. Advanced techniques like experience replay, adaptive 
exploration, and prioritized memory sampling are integrated to optimize training efficiency 
and learning stability. The AI continuously improves its decision-making accuracy, ensuring 
smoother gameplay and better obstacle avoidance. 
The study highlights the potential of deep learning in automating gameplay, demonstrating 
that AI can effectively master even simple arcade-style games. The findings provide insights 
into sequential decision-making, which can be applied to broader AI research, including 
robotics, autonomous systems, and real-world adaptive learning environments. Furthermore, 
this research explores how deep learning models trained on one game can be adapted to other 
games with similar mechanics, improving AI generalization capabilities. 
Future advancements in this field could focus on transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi
game adaptation, allowing AI models to handle more complex gaming environments. 
Enhancing training frameworks to improve learning speed and model robustness can further 
contribute to AI-driven game automation, decision-making, and reinforcement learning 
research. This study serves as a foundation for integrating AI into real-time applications, 
bridging the gap between game automation and real-world decision-making tasks.
